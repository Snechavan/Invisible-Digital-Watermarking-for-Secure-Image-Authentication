🎨 **Invisible Digital Watermarking for Secure Image Authentication** 🔐

🚀 **Project Overview**

In the world of digital media, protecting the authenticity of images is paramount. With **Invisible Digital Watermarking**, this project embeds a **hidden watermark** (message, logo, etc.) into an image, which is **undetectable to the human eye** but can be reliably **extracted** and **detected** through advanced algorithms. Even if the image is **compressed**, **resized**, or **modified**, the watermark remains intact and detectable. 🔍✨

🔑 **Why Is This Important?**
- **Protects Image Integrity**: Safeguard digital content from unauthorized usage and alterations.
- **Invisible Yet Detectable**: The watermark is hidden from view but can be extracted for validation or authentication.
- **Resilience**: The watermark survives even after **compression** or **resizing**—two common image manipulations.

## 🛠️ **Installation**

To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

### 1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/invisible-watermarking.git
cd invisible-watermarking
```

### 2. **Install the dependencies:**
You can quickly install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install them individually with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scipy
```

### **Extract the Watermark**

Once the watermark is embedded, you can extract it like this:

```python
extract_watermark("watermarked_image.jpg")
```

## 🖼️ **How It Works**

This algorithm uses **frequency-domain** techniques, such as **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)** and **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**, to embed watermarks in a way that **does not alter the visual appearance** of the image but makes the watermark **robust** enough to survive common image manipulations. 

### **Steps:**
1. **Embed the watermark** in the frequency domain using the DCT/DFT technique.
2. **Extract the watermark** using inverse transformations.
3. Ensure that the watermark **remains detectable** even after compression (JPEG) or resizing.

## 🎯 **Example**

Here's how to easily embed and extract watermarks in your own images:

```python
# Embedding a watermark into an image
embed_watermark("input_image.jpg", "watermark_logo.png", alpha=0.05)

# Extracting the watermark from the watermarked image
extract_watermark("output_image.jpg")
```
