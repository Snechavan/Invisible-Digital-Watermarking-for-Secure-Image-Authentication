🎨 Invisible Digital Watermarking for Secure Image Authentication 🔐
🚀 Project Overview
In the world of digital media, protecting the authenticity of images is paramount. With Invisible Digital Watermarking, this project embeds a hidden watermark (message, logo, etc.) into an image, which is undetectable to the human eye but can be reliably extracted and detected through advanced algorithms. Even if the image is compressed, resized, or modified, the watermark remains intact and detectable. 🔍✨

🔑 Why Is This Important?
Protects Image Integrity: Safeguard digital content from unauthorized usage and alterations.
Invisible Yet Detectable: The watermark is hidden from view but can be extracted for validation or authentication.
Resilience: The watermark survives even after compression or resizing—two common image manipulations.
